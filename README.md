# ansible_automation
Ansible automation scripts for setting up a new mac machine

## TODO

- [] VM for testing automation changes

## Approach

- scripts/install.sh
  - install brew as a LOT depends on its existence
  - install ansible via brew
  - install git
  - install ohmyzsh if not exist (this check will handled by ansible)
    - nuke the zshrc so the one pulled in by yadm can be usedk
  - install yadm via brew
    - yadm clone your dotfiles repo
    - Replace the .zshrc created/modified by ohmyzsh installation with the one in dotfiles
      - Best way is to replace, need to see shell commands for that (maybe rm zshrc before yadm clone?
  - install powerlevel10k from scripts/install.sh
    - configure this manually
  - install zsh-autosuggestions
  - install rust
- Install homebrew packages
- Install homevrew cask packages

had to run this ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
